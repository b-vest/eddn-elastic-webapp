          <h2>EDDN To Elasticsearch To Node WebApp Project</h2>
          <p>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to use Elasticsearch, Node.js, WebSockets, and the EDDN feed to build a dynamic web application that brings the world of Elite Dangerous to life. By leveraging Elasticsearch as the data indexing and search engine, Node.js for server-side development, and WebSockets for real-time communication, we can create a powerful and responsive application.</p>

          <p>But before we dive into the technical details, let me give you a brief overview of what we'll be doing. We'll start by setting up Elasticsearch and Node.js, which are the core components of our application. Elasticsearch will handle the indexing and searching of our game data, while Node.js will provide the server-side logic and handle WebSocket communication.</p>

          <p>Once we have our foundation in place, we'll integrate the EDDN feed into our application. The EDDN feed is a real-time data stream that provides valuable information about the game. We'll leverage this feed to keep our application updated with the latest game events, market prices, and more.</p>

          <p>Throughout this guide, I'll walk you through the installation and setup of Elasticsearch and Node.js. We'll configure Elasticsearch to run as a single-node cluster, making it easy to set up and work with. We'll also install the necessary packages using NPM (Node Package Manager) and use PM2 (Process Manager 2) to manage our Node.js server.</p>

          <p>Once our development environment is ready, we'll write the code to parse the incoming EDDN data and ingest it into Elasticsearch. This will ensure that our application has access to the latest game data in real-time. We'll also create a WebSocket server to establish a real-time connection with the client-side of our application.</p>

          <p>With the data flowing in and the server-side logic in place, we'll then focus on building captivating visualizations using libraries like D3.js and Three.js. These visualizations will bring the game data to life and provide an engaging user experience.</p>

          <p>It's important to note that while this guide is specifically tailored for Elite Dangerous and the EDDN feed, you can adapt the concepts and techniques to suit your own project requirements. Feel free to explore and experiment with the tools and libraries we'll be using.</p>

          <p>So, if you're ready to embark on this exciting journey of building your own EDDN Datastream application, let's get started!</p>
