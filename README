#### Project Summary

This project focuses on building an EDDN Datastream application that harnesses the power of real-time data updates from the EDDN (Elite Dangerous Data Network). The point of this project is not so much about an addon to the game but more about working with a realtime dataset that is rich with data types. 

By leveraging technologies such as Elasticsearch, Node.js, and WebSockets, this application enables efficient data indexing, server-side development, and real-time communication.

The guide covers the installation and setup of Elasticsearch and Node.js, along with server configuration and WebSocket establishment. It also delves into real-time data processing, indexing, and searching using Elasticsearch. Engaging user experiences are created through visualizations powered by libraries such as D3.js and Three.js.

While the project focuses on Elite Dangerous and the EDDN feed, the concepts and techniques can be adapted to suit specific requirements. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of working with real-time data, analyzing it effectively, and creating captivating visualizations.

Join us on this exciting journey of building your own EDDN Datastream application and explore the dynamic world of real-time data.
